/*
 * A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one anotherâ€™s shoulders. 
 * For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. 
 * Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, 
 * write a method to compute the largest possible number of people in such a tower.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input (ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110)
 * 
 * Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom: 
 * (56, 90) (60,95) (65,100) (68,110) (70,150) (75,190)
